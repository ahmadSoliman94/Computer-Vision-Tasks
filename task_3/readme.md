## Task 3: 

### you will explore the concepts of blur filter, Gaussian filter, median filter, and bilateral filter in image processing. 
### You will need to apply these filters to a set of images and compare the results to determine which filter is most effective for each image. 
### You will also need to provide a brief theoretical explanation of each filter and its applications in real-world scenarios.

### instructions:
### 1. Choose a set of images to work with. These can be images from your personal collection or images that you find online.
### 2. Apply each of the following filters to the images using Python:
- #### Blur filter.
- #### Gaussian filter.
- #### Median filter.
- #### Bilateral filter.
### 3. Experiment with different filter parameters and compare the results to determine which filter is most effective for each image. You should consider factors such as noise reduction, edge preservation, and detail preservation.

### 4. Provide a brief theoretical explanation of each filter and its applications in real-world scenarios. Your explanation should include the basic principles of each filter, how it works, and its advantages and disadvantages. You may use online resources or textbooks to support your explanation.


### 5. Discuss the mathematical equation of each filter and how it relates to itsvpractical application. You should include the formula for each filter andvexplain how the parameters of the equation affect the filter's performance. You may use online resources or textbooks to support your discussion.
